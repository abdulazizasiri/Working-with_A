CROS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing .

## What is CORS and why are we using it?

CORS works around the same-origin policy. The same-origin policy was implemented by web browsers to prevent malicious scripts from untrusted domains from running on a website. In other words, it ensures sure that scripts from one website can't insert themselves into another.
