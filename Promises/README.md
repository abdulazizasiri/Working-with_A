## The promise Syntax.

The promise is a constructor that takes a callback as a prameter. 

```
let promise = new Promise(Callback); 
```

Note: the callback takes two important args: 

1- resolve

2- reject

reject is used to handle the code that fulfills its promise.

reject handles the code that did not fulfill the promise.
